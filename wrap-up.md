# Wrap up

We were able to add the Javascript SDK to our app and then created a single `binance.js` file to manage all of our binance chain related functions.

{% page-ref page="connecting.md" %}

We then added the Keystore wallet option, reading the address and saving it in state. 

{% page-ref page="connect-to-wallet.md" %}

We then read the wallet balances to create a web-viewable wallet.

{% page-ref page="reading-the-wallet.md" %}

Finally we were able to create and send a Binance Chain transaction.

{% page-ref page="sending-a-transaction.md" %}

Thanks for joining us!

More tutorials will be posted here soon.
